## **Block Diagram**
The receiver is divided into the following stages:

1. **RF Amplifier** â€“ Amplifies the weak input RF signal.
2. **Mixer & Local Oscillator** â€“ Converts the RF signal to an intermediate frequency (IF).
3. **IF Amplifier** â€“ Further amplifies the IF signal.
4. **Detector & Audio Output** â€“ Extracts the original modulated signal.
